# Attendance-Management
Program For Students And Teachers To Manage Attandence With Login And Sign-Up


Program works with pre-defined TC ids.
Giving people random ids using pre-defined TC ids in the system.
Storing these ids to make registeration phase complete.
In registeration phase system checks user's input whether the inputs are valid or not.
When someone registers, program creates an user object and store their datas in that object.
While users logging to the system program checks if their inputs are matches with datas that stored in system.
When someone log in to the system a greeting page comes up.
The user can't resize our program.
